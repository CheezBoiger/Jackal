# Jackal 
Jackal Game Engine. In Development

# What is Jackal?
Jackal is an Open Source Game Engine with a focus on overall modern design. It is solely intended for better understanding how Game Engines (like Unreal and Unity) work from the inside. 


# How to Contribute?
This engine is not even implemented yet as we are building everything from scratch. If you would like to contribute, or give pointers on where we should be
